# CoinSensei
CoinSensei is a software application aimed to help people track their expenses, income, financial goals, and liabilities better, which are factors that significantly impact their financial health. The proposed application would contain a user-friendly interface to reduce intimidation for new users and to allow easier navigation while using the application (Add, Update, Delete, and Search). It also aims to promote a high-security system to prevent hackers from getting into a userâ€™s account using a secure database.
